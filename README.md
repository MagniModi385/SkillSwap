## Skill Swap Platform – Community-Based Skill Exchange

## Overview

*Skill Swap* is a web application that allows users to exchange skills directly with one another. Users can list skills they offer (e.g., Python, Photoshop) and request skills they want to learn (e.g., Excel, UI/UX Design). The platform promotes collaborative learning through a skill-bartering model that is simple, intuitive, and community-driven.
